      ASSESSMENTS</p>
      <p class="whitetable_text">We use a number of assessments to help people better understand themselves and others. Several of the most popular ones are: </p>
      <p class="brown_header_nomargin">Behavioral Style DISC™ Profile</p>
      <p class="whitetable_text">DISC™ is the universal language of behavior and emotions. This profile tells us HOW someone will act – their manner of doing things. It provides insight into communication style, natural behavior, and any adaptations that are being made to get work done. Often these adaptations limit the results that can be produced and/or interfere with the ability to work well with others. Management/Staff, Sales, or Executive Reports are available.<br />
        <br />
        <span class="brown_header_nomargin">Workplace Motivators™</span></p>
      <p class="whitetable_text">How can you place the right people in the right jobs and motivate them to achieve more for the organization? The answer would be to understand their values. Values are the drivers behind behavior; what motivates a person to take action. Values address WHY people act. Sometimes the values of an employee are inconsistent with those required by the job they are in. This report is really valuable in the hiring process, and then for workforce development.<br />
        <br />
        <span class="brown_header_nomargin">Interviewing Insights™</span></p>
    <p class="whitetable_text">Reveals the behavioral characteristics of a candidate, his or her ideal work environment and value to the organization. We use this report for Interviewing &amp; Selection applications. Finding the right talent for specific jobs is not just desirable, but ESSENTIAL to business success. Tools that add value to the hiring process are increasingly popular with human resource professionals, line managers and business owners. General and Sales Interviewing Insights™ reports are designed to assist in preparing for and executing an effective interview. This report promises to significantly increase the success of your hiring process.<br />
