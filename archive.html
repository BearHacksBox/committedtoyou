    How to Get Unstuck – and – When to Stay Stuck</a><br />
	 If it’s merely a case of re-motivating yourself, there are many ways to do so.  Sometimes the things that motivate you into action aren’t possible because of your current situation. What can you do about that? On the other hand there are times when being stuck is absolutely perfect.  When is that so? </p>

    Being Stuck</a><br />
	 There are times when we find ourselves stuck.   Some of us even have been given good suggestions for moving forward, but have “yah but” reasons for not being able to.  “Yah but” I’m not good enough, not young enough, not old enough, are just a few of many possibilities.  There are also real reasons for inaction – and many ways to get back in action if that is what you want to do.  </p>

    You Notice Typos?</a><br />
	The typographical error in the April Power Byte was an unexpected surprise.  The opportunity of that surprise was an extra Power Byte addressing your interpretation of the error if you actually saw it.  Many didn’t because of how we read according to the research done on the subject.  There is an entire paragraph that demonstrates the research.  Enjoy! </p>

    Surprise!</a><br />
	Life is an exciting adventure filled with unexpected surprises.  How come we experience some of those surprises as breakdowns or problems.  This Power Byte addresses the impact of your attitude on your experience of life – all of life – including times when it is not going the way we planned.  It’s about learning to dance in the rain. </p>

    If Not For Them….</a><br />
	There are people who seem to steal your power.  If not for them your life would be wonderful.  This Power Byte addresses the disempowering boss.  There are questions to ask yourself to determine how to deal with it if you want to keep your job – and looks at when it may be time to move on. </p>

    Don’t Stop the Pain</a><br />
	Loss can be very painful and is also a great growth opportunity.  This Power Byte explores why it’s important to experience the emotions connected with a loss fully. There are things to get maximum value from the loss.  When they’re done you will know it’s time to move on.  Then what next?</p>

	January 2011<br />
    Fired Up or Creeping Gently</a><br />
	Start the New Year by claiming your power.  Don’t let your BS (Belief System) get in the way.  It’s time to feel your power and shine your light.  Even baby eagles need to be pushed from the nest to do what they came to do.  What is your destiny?  What do you need to do?</p>

    Do You Play Well With Others?</a><br />
	You can destroy your career if you don’t know how to build relationships and aren’t a team player who plays well with others.  When did being nice become important.  Isn’t taking charge and driving in results the key to succeeding?</p>

    Who Make the Best Leaders?</a><br />

    What Really Upset You?</a><br />
	Your upsets happen automatically and you usually have an explanation for why you’re upset.  The explanation is often not the source of the upset.  Where do the reactions come from and what can you do to avoid them?</p>
